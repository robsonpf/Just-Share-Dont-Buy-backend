## Overview
* The main purpose for Just Share, Don't Buy is to allow downtown residents the ability to share items with their neighbors that are rarely used and difficult to store. These items could include a step ladder, carpet cleaner, tennis racquet, or event space such as a backyard patio and/or conference room. 

* Our motivation came from living in small apartments in San Francisco, CA that have very little closet space. Most people would not want to take up the little space they do have to store an item that only gets used once per month. If our neighbors have the item we are looking for, there should be a place to post the item and have it available to share with neighbors close by. Just Share, Don't Buy is the answer to this problem.

## Methods Used
* Exploring the files, you will be able to see our RESTful patterns and the schema the HTTP methods work off of. The methods are defined through our query folder and then a seperate folder file for each migration table. Our MVC design pattern is found within the src folder and then further categorized by each migration table as well for better organization. 
* Our database schema was developed using knex migrations and seeds. Our schema is normalized and can be found in more detail within the seeds and migrations folders which are then seperated by specific table. 

## Challenges and Future Plans
* Our team was challenged with keeping all data connected with our HTTP requests within the javascript files. In the future we plan on redefining certain functions to make the code more readible and organized.
